# CPU-SCHEDULER
CPU Scheduler Simulator A simulator that demonstrates various CPU scheduling algorithms to help understand operating system process management concepts. 
Overview This project implements a simulation environment for popular CPU scheduling algorithms. It visualizes how different scheduling techniques affect process execution, waiting times, turnaround times, and overall system efficiency. 

Simulation of multiple CPU scheduling algorithms:

1.First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) 
2.Shortest Job First (SJF) 
3.Priority Scheduling 
4.Round Robin (RR) 
5.Multilevel Feedback Queue

Detailed metrics for algorithm comparison:

1.Average waiting time 
2.Average turnaround time 
3.CPU utilization 
4.Throughput

Interactive visualization of process execution Custom process creation with configurable parameters Batch simulation for comparative analysis

This is the end.
